1. Open Minecraft.
2. Create a new world and click on "Data Packs".
3. Drag the datapack .zip archive into the Minecraft window; It should be in its original .zip file format.
4. Click "Yes" on the confirmation screen.
5. Enable the datapack by moving it to the right hand side of the screen by clicking the triangle on its icon.
6. Click "Done" and continue creating your world, then click on "Create New World" once you have configured any other settings that you wish to modify.
7. If the datapack release was in the correct format for your specific Minecraft version, it would be enabled in the world upon its initial generation. You can verify that the datapack has successfully loaded and is enabled by typing `/datapack list` enabled and find an entry named [file/your data pack file/directory name]; You must have [cheats](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands#Usage) enabled in order to use the command.
